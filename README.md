## Problem Definition
The goal of this project is to predict the outcome of football matches (win, lose, or draw) based on historical match data and team performance metrics. This is a **multi-class classification problem**, where the target variable is the match outcome (e.g., Home Win, Away Win, Draw).

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017). It contains international football match results from 1872 to 2017, including features such as:
- `date`: Date of the match.
- `home_team`: Name of the home team.
- `away_team`: Name of the away team.
- `home_score`: Goals scored by the home team.
- `away_score`: Goals scored by the away team.
- `tournament`: Type of tournament (e.g., Friendly, World Cup).
- `city`: City where the match was played.
- `country`: Country where the match was played.
- `neutral`: Boolean indicating if the match was played on neutral ground.
